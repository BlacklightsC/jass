Creep Info
}
STRING 548
{
- Creeps are completely rebalanced. No too easy levels in between now, and overall, it got harder.
- Still every 5th level is harder and has more creeps.
- Still level 36+ get very hard. Last level is 40.

To see how much HP the current level has (CreepInfo), type
-ci
If you want to get this information each level, use
-on / -off

Area 51? The Scientist there is trying to find out how much EHP a creep of the current round has.
What is EHP? It means "Effective Hit Points". A creep with 100 HP and 50% damage reduction has 150 EHP.

How to play
}
STRING 550
{
1) Be sure to use your Goldmine.
2) Upgrade. Don't mass.
3) Watch the armor types and Tower descriptions.
4) Think a bit.
5) Lean back and enjoy.

Remember it's a team game which cant be won alone. Sometimes it's better to give gold to another player instead of enforcing a lane that would never leak anyways.

If you won the map, feel free to send the replay to Spziokles@gmx.li

STRING 551
{
Leavers
}
STRING 552
{
- You can't leave your designated spot, which would have caused big problems with leavers.
- To avoid that, the appropriate spawn gets reduced a bit if a player defending those creeps leaves the game.
- His Castle, Gold Mine and stuff gets wasted, his towers are sold and the money shared to those who defend at his lane(s). Seems more fair than a lucky 2nd Gold Mine and so on.

- Side-note: Due to the dynamic Spawn trigger, it's now possible to play the map solo or with just a few friends.

STRING 553
{
Ultimates & Chaos Ranger
}
STRING 554
{
- Tooltips of Chaos Ranger enhanced to clearify the question what towers to max out to get the specific Ultimate to upgrade the Chaos Ranger.
- Chaos Ranger rebalanced
- Upgrade Bugs of the Rangers of red and yellow removed.

- Beetle + Element --> Death Tower (Magic damage, for blue and orange)
- Beetle + Treant --> Decay Tower (Normal damage, for teal and pink)
- Beetle + Wolfy --> Hell Tower (Piercing damage, for purple and green)
- Element + Treant --> Evil Tower (Siege damage, for red and yellow)

New:
- Element + Wolfy --> Speed Aura
- Treant + Wolfy --> Damage Aura

Credits
}
STRING 556
{
- All Credits to Zwuckel, who created this map!
- Modified by CS_Fan, this version is based on his version 11.5.
- Further modified by Gruufhai, who's a noob at coding and got great help from Xoc.NineVoltDevil Added Backward Spawns..
}
STRING 557
{
To be continued...
}
STRING 558
{
- Please report bugs. You can email them to Spziokles@gmx.li (be sure to place some good keywords in your topic or it will be trashed), or try to catch Gruufhai on Northrend.
- As I'm no native english speaker/writer, I'll also be glad to get corrections of my grammar and stuff.
- The Map is still under construction (May 2006). Which means, don't expect it do be complete, and it also means it's still a good time to send in ideas, critics, wishes or nice chick picks.

{
Damage and Armor types
}
STRING 560
{
- Damage / Armor table rewritten! Forget all you know about Zwuckel TD Towers and read the tooltips!
- Each tower is useful now, because now there is always exactly one tower that defends against a certain creep armor.
}
STRING 564
{
Check out the Quests! Even for experienced Zwuckel players, 'cause it's a very new version!
}
STRING 566

Use your Goldmine!
